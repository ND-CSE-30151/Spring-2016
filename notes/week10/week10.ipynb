    "Now that we've proven that one language ($A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$) is undecidable, we can use it to prove that other languages are undecidable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example is the halting problem. In many textbooks (and the poem \"Scooping the Loop Snooper\"), the halting problem is actually the prototypical undecidable language, but Sipser does things a little differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof is not difficult but it has a weird feel to it. The first thing that you have to remember is that the direction of the reduction is the opposite of what most people intuitively think of first. If you want to show that the halting problem is undecidable, you do _not_ reduce the halting problem to $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$. You assume that the halting problem _is_ decidable, then show via a reduction from $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$ to the halting problem that $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$ would also be decidable, which is a contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theorems 5.2 and 3 are slightly different. They are both proofs of the undecidability of questions of the form \"Does $L(M)$ belong to such-and-such a language class?\". So the proofs go like this. Assume that the question is decidable, so there is a TM $C$ that decides it. Now we need to construct a new TM $S$ that decides $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$. Somehow, $S$ needs to use $C$, and $C$ expects to receive _another_ TM as input. So $S$ constructs another TM (called $M_1$ or $M_2$ in the book) for this purpose. As the book points out, the weird thing is that we do not actually run this machine; we just feed it into $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick here is that the putative machine $C$ is able to do its job even if its argument doesn't halt on some inputs. The only hard part about deciding $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$ is detecting when a machine doesn't halt, so $S$ delegates this task to $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you like, you could think of $S$ as a Python function..."
